# Motion estimation algorithms

This repository consists some motion estimation algorithms:

- Logarithmic search
- Classical gradient descent
- Diamond search (variation of gradient descent)
- Some useful tools

LOG.py - script with logarithmic search algorithm
GRAD.py - script with classical gradient descent and diamond search
utils.py - script with tools

A [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/) training set was used to test the algorithms.
